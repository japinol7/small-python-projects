## Functional programming concepts applied to Python

	Small programs in Python using functional approaches to leverage 
    code as data transformations.

    When using Python for functional programming, we will not use a 
    pure functional approach. 
    Instead, we will focus in hybrid programming techniques that are 
    not strictly functional.
