Array to Phone Number
---------------------

Write a program that given an array of 10 integers
returns a phone number as a string.

You can assume that the numbers in the input array
will be integers between 0 and 9.

Examples
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  ->  "(000) 000-0000"
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]  ->  "(123) 456-7890"
[1, 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 2]  ->  "(103) 456-7892"
[1, 5, 1, 0, 5, 3, 7, 7, 9, 1]  ->  "(151) 053-7791"
range(10)  ->  "(012) 345-6789"
