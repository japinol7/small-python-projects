Missing Positive Integer
------------------------

Write a program that, given an array A of N integers,
returns the smallest positive integer greater than 0
that does not occur in the array.

Where:
* N is an integer within the range [1, 1_000_000]
* Each element of A is an integer within the range [−1_000_000, 1_000_000].

Example test cases:
* given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 7], the function should return 5.
* Given A = [−1, −3], the function should return 1.
