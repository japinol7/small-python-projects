# cyber-dojo. A place to practice programming

https://cyber-dojo.org

https://blog.cyber-dojo.org/

What was the inspiration for cyber-dojo?
In 2009, I (Jon) was consulting in Norway. A user-group organized an evening coding-dojo (in a local pub).
An exercise, language, and test-framework was picked, and participants split into teams of about 5 people.
After ~90 minutes everyone gathered for a review...
* Two teams had nothing to show since they were still trying to install the language and test-framework (using the pub wifi).
* The other teams spent a long long long time trying to connect their laptops to the projector (Linux, Mac, & Windows)

I became convinced an online coding-dojo was a worthwhile project
practising programming deserves more attention
effective development is a team activity

I think there is real benefit not practising in a professional IDE:
cyber-dojo is about learning — an IDE about development
cyber-dojo is for working together — an IDE typically alone
cyber-dojo aims to improve skills — an IDE to finish products
cyber-dojo promotes coding & testing — an IDE, mostly coding
cyber-dojo helps you work slower — an IDE faster
